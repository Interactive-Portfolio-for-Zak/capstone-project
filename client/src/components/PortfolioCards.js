                <Card.Text>From January to March â€˜21 I enrolled in the ElevenFifty Academy UX/UI Bootcamp. For our first project we were given a fictional product that we would be working with. The product was an online classroom tool that is being built. Users of the platform will include teachers, students, and parents. This project took us through building our first fully realized design. User Research, user flow, design thinking and design system building, wireframing, and prototyping skills were all learned and then applied for this project. The second and final project was a group project. As a group of 4 we were assigned a brand redesign for a DTC coffee company. Original site had little branding and a grayscale user interface. We then had to present to the client our solutions. Full presentation deck, video of click through, and user research and personas were built to inform the design for the company. I was our design system manager, so my role was to build out the entire design system our Lead Designer would use to build out the high fidelity mockups.</Card.Text>
